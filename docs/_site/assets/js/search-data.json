    "content": "Blip conventions provide consistency and structure to make writing plans and reporting metrics easier. Although the built-in sinks report fully-qualified metric names (status.global.threads_running), your custom sink can rename and report metrics however you want. For example, your sink could ignore Blip domains completely and report only metric names (threads_running), or report a simpler custom prefix (mysql.threads_running). Metrics . Naming . Blip strives to report MySQL metric names as-is—no modifications—so that what you see in MySQL is what you get in Blip. However, MySQL metric names are very inconsistent: . | Foo_bar (most common) | Foo_Bar (replica status) | foo_bar (InnoDB metrics) | foo_bar_count (type suffix) | foo_bar_usec (unit suffix) | . For consistency, Blip metric names have three requirements: . | Only snake_case | Always lowercase | No prefixes or suffixes | . A fully-qualified metric name includes a domain: status.global.threads_running. The metric name is always the last field (split on .). Types . Blip metric types are standard: . | UNKNOWN | COUNTER | GAUGE | BOOL | EVENT | . Most metrics are counters; a few are gauges. Blip, like MySQL, does not distinguish between “counter” and “cumulative counter”. Blip counter metrics can reset to zero if MySQL is restarted; otherwise, the value only increases. Currently, Blip does not report bool or event metrics, but these are reserved for future use. The unknown type is used only for error detection. Values . All values, regardless of type, are float64. Units . MySQL metrics use a variety of units—from picoseconds to seconds. When the MySQL metric unit is documented and consistent, Blip reports the value as-is. For example, innodb.buffer_flush_avg_time is documented as “Avg time (ms) spent for flushing recently.”, therefore Blip reports the value as-is: as milliseconds. When the MySQL metric unit is variable, Blip uses the following units: . | Metric Type | Unit | . | Query time | microseconds (μs) | . | Lock time | microseconds (μs) | . | Wait time | microseconds (μs) | . | Replication (lag) | milliseconds (ms) | . | Data size | bytes | . For example, query response time ranges from nanoseconds to seconds (with microsecond precision) depending on the source. But regardless of the source, Blip reports query.*.response_time as microseconds (μs). To convert units, use the TransformMetrics plugin or write a custom sink. Blip does not suffix metric names with units, and it does not strip the few MySQL metrics that have unit suffixes. ",

Snake case (“domain_name”) and camel case (“domainName”) are not allowed: the former is used by metrics, and the latter is not Blip style. Sub-domains . Blip uses sub-domains for two purposes: MySQL-grouped metrics, or metrics that are related but different. The error domain is an exmaple of metrics that are related by different. error.query and error.repl both comprise error-related metrics, hence the common root domain, but the specific metrics for each are different. Thestatus domain is an example of MySQL-grouped metrics. MySQL provides status metrics grouped by account, global, host, thread, and user. (Global is the most common, as in SHOW GLOBAL STATUS.) Blip has a sub-domain for each group—status.account, status.global, and so on—that makes advacned plans like the following possible: . level: collect: status.global: options: all: yes status.host: options: host: 10.1.1.1 metrics: - queries - threads_running . The plan snippet above collects all global status metrics (status.global) but only two status metrics for host 10.1.1.1 (status.host). MySQL-grouped metrics are an explicit group: status.host explicitly groups by host. See Reporting &gt; Groups for more details.

But a single instance of Blip—a single running blip binary—can monitor any number of MySQL instances: . In Blip lingo, a monitor collects metrics from a single instance of MySQL, as shown above. In short, “a monitor monitors MySQL.” . Monitors are the central concept in Blip, so let’s zoom in on one monitor to see what makes it ticks: . A monitor has more parts than shown above, but the three most important parts are: . Sinks Sinks send metrics to a graphing system. A monitor can send metrics to more than one sink. Blip has built-in sinks for SignalFx and Chronosphere, and it’s easy to write your own sink, which means Blip can send metrics anywhere. Plan A plan determines which metrics to collect. Blip has a default plan that collects more than 60 of the most important MySQL metrics. Plans can be customized, which means Blip can collect any MySQL metrics you need (or not collect metrics that you don’t need). Engine The engine does the real work: it collects metrics from MySQL according to a plan. You control the engine by customizing a plan (or just use the built-in default plan). Let’s zoom in on the engine: . Inside the engine, another part called a metrics collector (or collector for short) collects metrics for one domain: a logical group of MySQL metrics. Above, the engine has four collectors that correspond to four domains: . | Domain | Metrics | . | status.global | SHOW GLOBAL STATUS | . | var.global | SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES | . | repl | SHOW REPLICA STATUS, … | . | aws | CloudWatch Metrics | . First, notice that a collector is not required required to collect metrics from MySQL. An AWS collector, for example, collects related MySQL metrics from Amazon CloudWatch. But most collectors collect metrics from various outputs of MySQL. Second, why a new abstraction—why “domains”? Because MySQL metrics are unorganized, and some metrics can be obtained from multiple outpus. For example, you can obtain the global system variable max_connections from three different outputs (or commands): . | SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections'; | SELECT @@GLOBAL.max_connections; | SELECT * FROM global_variables WHERE variable_name='max_connections'; | . That’s a trivial exmaple. Metric domains become important—practically necessary—when you account for the MySQL Performance Schema (and sometimes the MySQL sys Schema), various command and output changes from MySQL 5.6 to 5.7 to 8.0, subtle differences between distributions (Oracle vs. Percona vs. MariaDB), and cloud providers (like Amazon RDS). Metric domains simplify how metrics are collected. As a user, you shouldn’t care how metrics are collected; you should only care which metrics are collected. Domains and plans make that possible. A level plan (or plan for short) configures which metrics to collect—by domain. Here’s a snippet of a plan that collects two metrics every 5 seconds: . key-perf-indicators: freq: 5s collect: status.global: metrics: - Queries - Threads_running . Plans specify at least one level: a named group of metrics collected at a unique frequency. In this example, the level name is key-perf-indicators, and its frequency (freq: 5s) is every 5 seconds: 5s, 10s, 15s, and so forth. It collects two metrics from the status.global domain: Queries and Threads_running. Real plans have several levels and tens (or hundreds) of metrics from various domains. For example, the built-in default plan has four levels and collects over 60 metrics. But here’s a simpler example with two levels: . key-perf-indicators: freq: 5s collect: status.global: metrics: - Queries - Threads_running database-sizes: freq: 60s collect: size.database: options: exclude: test_db,dba_stuff metrics: # Automatic . Now the plan has two levels: the original key-perf-indicators plus database-sizes every 60 seconds. Blip combines levels automatically: at 55 seconds, it collects only key-perf-indicators metrics; but at 60 seconds, it collects key-perf-indicators metrics and database-sizes metrics. In technical terms, Blip collects every level where freq % T == 0, where T is the number of seconds elapsed since the monitor started. You don't have to write a plan to use Blip because it has a built-in plan that collects the most common and important MySQL metrics, including meta-metrics like database sizes. Writing your own plan allows you to customize which metrics to collect and when (how frequently). Plans and levels allow you to collect different metrics at different frequencies. For example, you can collect and report key performance indicators every 5 seconds, but collect and report table sizes every 60s. This is more efficient and cost-effective, especially if you use a hosted metrics graphing solution. When the engine is done collecting metrics for a level, the monitor sends the metrics to one or more metric sink configured for the monitor. A sink is a plugin that accepts a Blip metrics data structure, then translates and sends the metrics somewhere. A sink can also rename metrics, add labels/dimensions/tags, and so forth—whatever is appropriate for the sink destination. Blip has built-in sinks for SignalFx and Chronosphere, but since the sink is a plugin, it’s trivial to write new sinks to support new destinations. Keep learning: Monitors ↓ . ",

Each instance is a YAML dictionary containing any of the monitor default sections with one exception: mysql variables are top-level in a monitor. The example below shows two different MySQL instances to monitor. monitors: - hostname: db1.local username: metrics password-file: \"/secret/db-password\" heartbeat: freq: 1s - mycnf: \"/secret/my.cnf\" exporter: mode: legacy . The first MySQL instance is configured in lines 3-7. (Note the single, leading hyphen on line 3 that denotes an item in a YAML list.) The first three variables—hostname, username, and password-file—are mysql variables but in a monitor they are top-level. But all other sections, like heartbeat and its variable freq, are exactly the same in a monitor. The second MySQL instance is configured in lines 9-11. Variable mycnf belongs to section mysql, but again: in a monitor, mysql variables are top-level. Section exporter is exactly the same in a monitor. Refer to Monitor Defaults for configuring MySQL instances, and remember: mysql variables are top-level in a monitor (omit mysql: and include the variables directly). Monitors have two variables that only appear in monitors: id and meta. id . | Type | string | . | Valid values | any string | . | Default value | (automatic) | . The id variable uniquely identifies the MySQL instance in Blip. Every monitor has a unique ID that, by default, Blip sets automatically. You can set monitor IDs manually, but it’s better to let Blip set them automatically to avoid duplicates (which causes a fatal error). Blip uses monitor IDs to track and report each MySQL instance in its own output and API. Blip does not use monitor IDs to identify MySQL instances for reporting metrics, but you can use them if you want. For example: . monitors: - id: db1 hostname: db1.local tags: monitorId: %{monitor.id} . Since tags are passed to sinks (which report metrics), all sinks will receive the monitor ID. (Sinks receive the monitor ID at the code-level too, so technically this example is not necessary.) . Monitor IDs are not garuanteed to be stable—they might change between Blip versions. Therefore, do not rely on them outside of Blip for truly stable, unique MySQL instance identification. meta . | Type | key-value map (string: string) | . | Valid values | any strings | . | Default value |   | . The meta variable is a map of key-value strings extrensic to Blip. “Extrensic to Blip” is a fancy but succinct way of saying that meta data is not used by Blip, but it can be used by you. For example by contrast, all other variables are used by Blip in some way, for some purpose. But not meta. However, you can still reference meta in the config file and plans: %{monitor.meta.KEY}. meta solves at least one problem: passing the source DSN for a replica from monitor config to plan. Imagine you have two MySQL instances: source.db and replica.db, where the latter replicates from the former. Problem is: there is no configuration section to define the source MySQL instance. Configuring replication sources in Blip is not an easy problem to solve because replication topologies change when replicas are used for high availability, and MySQL Group Replication has different requirements. To solve this problem, you configure the source DSN in meta: . monitors: - hostname: replica.db meta: source-host: source.db source-user: repl source-pass: pleaseDontLag . You could configure it in tags, too, but tags are copied to sinks whereas metadata is not. Therefore, this configuration is better placed in meta than tags. Then in the plan, reference the metadata: . replication: freq: 5s collect: repl: options: source-host: %{monitor.meta.source-host} source-user: %{monitor.meta.source-user} source-pass: %{monitor.meta.source-pass} metrics: - lag .

    "content": "Every MySQL instance that Blip monitors is called a monitor. For simplicity, the terms monitor and MySQL instance are synonymous because a monitor requires and represents only one MySQL instance. But there is more to a monitor than its MySQL instance. Monitor and MySQL instance are synonymous in Blip. Monitors are usually specified in the Blip config file, but they can be loaded various ways—more on this later. For now, it’s only necessary to know that monitors are listed in the YAML config file under the aptly named section moniotrs. The most basic Blip monitor is a simple hostname, username, and password: . monitors: - hostname: 127.0.0.1 username: blip password: aStrongRandomPassword . Or, if you want to use a my.cnf file: . monitors: - mycnf: ${HOME}/.my.cnf . A single Blip instances can monitor any number of MySQL instances. Here is a snippet of config that specifies three different MySQL instances: . monitors: - socket: /tmp/mysql.sock username: blip password-file: /dev/shm/metrics-password - hostname: 10.1.1.53 username: metrics password: foo - hostname: db3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com aws-rds: auth-token: true . The first instance is local: Blip connects using socket file /tmp/mysql.sock. The second instance is remote: Blip connects to IP 10.1.1.53. The third instance is an Amazon RDS for MySQL instance, and Blip uses IAM authentication. The point of these contrived examples is: Blip can monitor any MySQL instance anywhere it’s running. (If you have a case where this is not true, please file an issue.) . By default, Blip first attempts to load monitors from its config file (which is blip.yaml in the current working directory, by default). But the config file can specify other ways to load monitors: . monitor-loader: freq: 60s files: [monitors1.yaml, monitors2.yaml] . In short, that config snippet makes Blip load (read) monitor configuration from files monitors1.yaml and monitors2.yaml every 60 seconds. (Blip can dynamically load [add] and unload [remove] monitors while running.) The monitor-load config is optional; by default, Blip loads monitors from the monitors section in its config file. To further ensure that Blip can monitory any MySQL instance, loading monitors is an optional plugin with this callback signature: . LoadMonitors func(Config) ([]ConfigMonitor, error) . Hopefully, built-in features cover every use case, but if you have particular requirements (filtering out certain MySQL instances, for example), you can plug in your own code to load monitors. In addition to basic MySQL configuration—how to connect to MySQL: hostname, username, and password, and so forth—monitors have other optional features and configuration, summarized briefly in the following table. | Monitor Confg | Feature | . | aws | Amazon RDS authentication | . | exporter | Prometheus mysqld_exporter emulation | . | ha | High availability (not implemented yet) | . | heartbeat | Heartbeat to measure replication lag | . | meta | User-defined key-value data | . | plans | Monitor-specific plans for metrics collection | . | sinks | Monitors-specific sinks for sending metrics | . | tags | Monitor-specific key-value data passed to sinks | . | tls | TLS configuration | . That’s a lot of information, but the point is a lot simpler: Blip monitors can do almost anything. For the most part, these features support Blip in large, automated environments. If you don’t need a feature, you can forget about it: Blip is simple (and fully automatic) by default. When you need a feature, Blip most likely already supports it. One last helpful tip: . $ blip --print-moniotrs --run=false . The command line above starts (but does not run) Blip so that it loads monitors and prints them, then exits. This can help debug monitor loading and configuration. Why stop now; keep learning: Plans ↓ . ",

    "title": "Plans",
    "content": "A level plan (or plan for short) configures which metrics to collect. Plans solve three problems: . | Which metrics to collect? | How to collect those metrics? | How often to collect those metrics? | . The first problem arises because there are over 1,000 MySQL metrics but 0 standards for which metrics to collect. Some engineers collect nearly all metrics and use what they need in graphs. Some engineers collect as few metrics as possible due to costs. Some engineers don’t know what to collect, relying on monitor defaults to be useful. Plans help solve the first problem by not hard-coding which metrics to collect. Write a plan to collect only the metrics you need. Blip has a built-in default plan that collects more than 60 of the most important MySQL metrics, which might be all you need. The second problem arises because there are many versions and distributions of MySQL, which makes some metrics a moving target. For example: where do you collect a MySQL replication lag metric? The oldest and perhaps still most common source is Seconds_Behind_Master in the SHOW SLAVE STATUS output. But those two changed to Seconds_Behind_Source and SHOW REPLICA STATUS, respectively. And what if you don’t use those and, instead, use pt-heartbeat or the Blip built-in heartbeat? Or what if you’re running MySQL Group Replication? Or what if you run MySQL in the cloud and the cloud provider emits its own replication lag metric? . Plans help solve the second problem by using metric domains (or domains for short) to name logically-related group of MySQL metrics. Probably the most well known group is SHOW GLOBAL STATUS, to which Blip gives the domain name status.global. A replication lag metric is scoped within the repl domain (short for “replication”), which abstracts way the technical details of how it’s collected. When you write a plan that collects replication lag, the plan works everywhere because domains specify which metrics to collect, not necessarily how to collect them. The third problem arises from cost and storage limits: if everything was fast and free, you would collect all metrics every 1 second. But this is (almost) never done because it requires significant storage and processing, which lead to significant costs. Instead, the norm is collecting all metrics every 10, 20, or 30 seconds. But even 10 seconds is too long for a busy database because, for example, at only 5,000 QPS, that resolution averages out the metrics for 50,000 queries. Plans help solve the third problem by allowing you to collect different metrics at different frequencies—which is the “level” in the full term: “level plan”. It helps to remember as: “Higher the level, higher the wait (time between collection).” For example, imagine three levels as shown below. Level 1, the base level, is collected frequently (shortest wait time): every 5 seconds. Level 2 is collected less frequently: every 20 seconds. Level 3, the highest level, is collected the most infrequently (longest wait time): every 30 seconds. Blip automatically combines levels when they overlap and collects all metrics at that time. At 20 seconds (since Blip started collecting metrics for this plan), Blip collects metrics for both levels 1 and 2 because 20 mod 5 = 0 and 20 mod 20 = 0, respectively. At 30 seconds, Blip collects metrics for both levels 1 and 3 because 30 mod 5 = 0 and 30 mod 20 = 0, respectively. And at 60 seconds, Blip collects metrics for all three levels because 60 mod freq = 0. Blip plans can do more, but for this introduction it’s sufficient to know that they allow you to fine-tune metrics collection, which increases the quality of monitoring while reducing costs.

Blip uses the term group because it’s similar to MySQL GROUP BY. Implicit grouping means the metrics collector groups metrics automatically (or as configured in the plan by collector options). For example, the size.data collector, which collects database and table sizes, groups metrics by database name. As a result, each metric has a group key on db, like the following example: . size.database: - bytes: value: 50920482048 type: gauge group: db: foo - bytes: value: 8920482048 type: gauge group: db: bar - bytes: value: 59840964096 type: gauge group: db: \"\" # all databases . The metric is the same—bytes—but there are 3 instances of the metric for each of the 3 groups: db=foo, db=bar, and db=\"\". The last group, db=\"\", is how this collector represents the metric for all databases (the global group). Explicit grouping refers to MySQL-grouped metrics—see Sub-domains.

As shown above, there are 2 response_time metrics that differ by meta=p95 and meta=p999: the former is the 95th percentile response time, and the latter is the 99.9th percentile response time. Blip uses meta rather than prefixing or suffixing the metric name (see Conventions &gt; Metrics &gt; Naming). This makes metrics (by name) consistent: the metric is always response_time, not pN_response_time or response_time_pN where N could be any number.

    "content": "NOTE: You can skip this part of the introduction if: . | You use SignalFx, or | You use Chronosphere, or | You plan to use Blip to emulate and replace Prometheus `mysqld_exporter` | . Blip has built-in support for these three use cases. Blip ships with built-in and automatic support for almost everything, but the one thing we (the Blip developers) cannot know is where you (the user) will send metrics. Consequently, you might need to develop a Blip metric sink to translate and send Blip metrics to your metrics store or metrics graphing solution. Don’t worry: Bilp was intentionally designed to make this easy. This brief introduction shows the high-level process of developing a new Blip metric sink. The following presumes that you’re an experienced Go programmer. All Blip sinks implement this interface: . type Sink interface { Send(context.Context, *Metrics) error Status() string } . Unsurprisingly, Blip calls the Send method to send metrics. The vast majority of work to implement a new sink is this one method. More on this in a moment. Blip calls the Status method to report real-time status of the sink (along with all other parts in the monitor). The reported status can be anything you think is useful to know; for exmaple, the last error sending metrics (if any). Let’s presume, for a moment, that you have implement a new sink. To allow Blip to make (instantiate) that sink, you implement one last interface: . type SinkFactory interface { Make(name, monitorId string, opts, tags map[string]string) (Sink, error) } . When a monitor uses your sink, Blip calls your sink factory to make a new sink for the monitor. Blip passes to your factory: . | Sink name (which is slightly redundant, but nobody is perfect) | Monitor ID (all monitors have a unique ID for status, logging, and so forth”) | Options (from the monitor config) | Tags (from the monitor config) | . Options are sink-specific options; for example, an API token is common for authenticating to hosted metrics solutions. Tags describe the metrics; some metrics solutions calls these “dimensions”, others call them “labels”—Blip calls them “tags”. Options are tags are set in the monitor config, which you’ll learn more about later. Here’s a mock (incomplete and nonfunctional) implementation of a sink (called “Kim” for an engineer who left us [the Blip developers] to join a metrics solution startup) and sink factory, just to give you an idea: . import ( \"context\" \"github.com/cashapp/blip\" ) type Kim struct { tags map[string]string client Client // sink-specific client } func NewKim(monitorId string, opts, tags map[string]string) *Kim { return &amp;Kim{ tags: tags, client: NewClient(opts[\"addr\"], opts[\"api-token\"]), } } func (k *Kim) Send(cxt context.Context, metrics *blip.Metrics) error { // Metrics are grouped by/keyed on domain name for domain := range metrics { // Loop through metrics in each domain for i := range metrics[domain] { m := metrics[domain][i] // Name: m.Name (string) // Value: m.Value (float64) // Type: m.Type (const byte) // Transform Blip metrics to sink-specific struct/protocol } } // Send sink-specific struct/protocol (km) return k.client.Send(ctx, km) } func (k *Kim) Status() string { return \"I miss where I used to work\" } // -------------------------------------------------------------------------- type KimFactory struct{} func (f KimFactory) Make(name, monitorId string, opts, tags map[string]string) (blip.Sink, error) { k := NewKim(monitorId, opts, tags) return k, nil } . For real sinks, see the built-in Blip sinks: blip/sinks. Once your implementation is done, you register the sink with Blip: . sink.Register(\"kim\", KimFactory{}) . More on this later; for now, the point is that you register your sink with a given name (“kim”), and that name is important because it’s what you specify in a monitor config to make Blip instantiate the sink. Following is a snippet of a monitor config that shows how the “kim” sink is used and configured: . monitors: - id: host1 hostname: host1.local sinks: kim: addr: https://local.domain api-token: ABC123 tags: env: staging region: us-east-1 . On line 5, the “kim” sink is specified, and lines 6 and 7 are its options. Lines 9 and 10 are tags for the monitor, which are also passed to the sink when created. Bottom line: Blip sinks are pure plugins, so you can make Blip send metrics anywhere. Enough talk; let’s run: Quick Start ↓ . ",
