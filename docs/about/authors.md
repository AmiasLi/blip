Sublime MySQL monitoring

Blip was designed and created by [Daniel Nichter](https://hackmysql.com) from 2021 to 2022 while working for [Cash App](https://cash.app/)&mdash;part of [Block](https://block.xyz).

Significant contributions, testing, and feedback were made by his colleagues at Block:

* [Joy Nag](https://github.com/joycse06)
* [Wenhui Sun](https://github.com/wen-hui-sun)
* [Ian Oberst](https://github.com/Areson)
* [Prudhvi Dhulipalla](https://github.com/prudhvi)
* [Serj Sililian](https://github.com/serjSquare)
* [Jemiah Westerman](https://github.com/jemiahw)
* [Allan Liu](https://github.com/allanliu)
* [Morgan Tocker](https://github.com/morgo)
* [Jash Lal](https://github.com/JashLal)

Blip is named after legendary engineer-turned-manager [Brian Ip](https://github.com/BrianIp), who&mdash;as an intern&mdash;wrote a MySQL monitor for [Square](https://squareup.com/) that worked and provided value for nearly a decade.
Blip strives to do half a well and make Brian proud.
