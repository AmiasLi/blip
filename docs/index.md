**TL;DR**:  Start with the [Introduction](v1.0/intro/concepts.html), then try the [Quick Start](v1.0/quick-start).

Blip is an extremely advanced yet exceptionally easy-to-use MySQL monitor.
It collects MySQL metrics from _anywhere_: on-premise bare metal, RDS in the cloud, developers' laptops, and some people's dreams.

Blip was designed from the ground up to be the best and the last MySQL monitor ever written.
It has many features and capabilities, but what really matters is that it [solves real problems](about/problem-solved).
